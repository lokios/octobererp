OIMS App :

1) App image optimisation should be upload upto 2 mb images only.
done

2) Show entry pending in outbox on header panel with number of items pending in badges (something like new notification alert). Onclick it starts sending notifications
pending

3) Voucher entries as like MR entries.
done

4) Need to implement checks for the below listed permissions on attendance
- if user have permission for "my_attendances" then he can make attendance of himself only.
- if user have permission for "attendances" then he can make attendance of all for his access project list

done
No change mobile side - we will only do server side validations ::

Added in beforeSave of /octobererp/plugins/olabs/social/models/EntityRelations.php

if (!isset($entry['employee_id']))
                return;

            $self_attendance = false;

            if($app->hasPermisson('olabs.oims.my_attendances')){
                if($entry['employee_id'] != "".$app->getAppUserId()){
                    throw new Exception("Error Processing Request", 403);
                    
                }else{
                    $self_attendance  = true;
                }
            }


            if(!$self_attendance  && !$app->hasPermisson('olabs.oims.attendances')){
               
                    throw new Exception("Error Processing Request", 403);
                    
               
            }
5) If user have permission for "vouchers" then he can make a voucher entry for his projects.
done :
   1. we return menu item in mobile only if we have olabs.oims.vouchers permission
   2. also added permission check server side in beforeSave of /octobererp/plugins/olabs/social/models/EntityRelations.php
        if ($this->target_type == self::TARGET_TYPE_VOUCHERS && !$this->status) {
            $this->status = self::STATUS_LIVE;

            $entry = $this->data;
            if (!$entry)
                return;
            $entry = $entry[0];

            
           
            
            if(  !$app->hasPermisson('olabs.oims.vouchers')){
               
                    throw new Exception("Error Processing Request", 403);
                    
               
            }

        }

Hi sir, 

Did we get any updates for resure?

Basides we may do followings sometime -
1. avoid scrolling of - location, activity/event selection and subsequent screens as possible
2. reduce Next + arrow spaces
3. "Step N". " title text" on all screen : "Step N " should be non-prominent with greyish font
4. Make the PDF downloads - per policy basis at server side
5. profile edits improvements
6. OTP based account activations
7. We may try for Flutter upgared to Dart 2 - Earlier tried, We may use geocoder alternative (already found an alternative which we may try). However the carousal plugin might need a alternative to be found.
8. add flutter "User drawer header": circular avatar + username + email
9. show profile circular avatar if uploaded in top left profile icon

Thanks


Thanks Sir,

Got fair idea . I think its good approach mentioned.
Though i think, by 1. adding footer navigations & 2. by reduing steps/sreen scrolls the app may look good in next versions, there decision seems good.

I just have following opinion: Please review and suggest for any changes

LL:
profie completion, 
OTP authentication, - via Firebase ( may take help from Ajay)
PDF for policy

LL/Anuj: Receiving Notifications - Backend

LL/Ajay : Receiving Notifications - App : android - LL / ios - Ajay

Anuj: Audit System to track changes being made in the system

Ajay: Google and Facebook login/signup integration on the login screen. ( I already have google auth code, maybe it shall work)
Ajay: Profile from google and facebook to automatically populate our profile

LL: profile details to be expanded ??

Some of these tasks like OTP may depend on plugins we may use, and may depend on dart versions. It might be better to switch to new flutter ? 

If above seems ok, we shall come with some estimates & start progress

Thanks
