OIMS App :

1) App image optimisation should be upload upto 2 mb images only.
done

2) Show entry pending in outbox on header panel with number of items pending in badges (something like new notification alert). Onclick it starts sending notifications
pending

3) Voucher entries as like MR entries.
done

4) Need to implement checks for the below listed permissions on attendance
- if user have permission for "my_attendances" then he can make attendance of himself only.
- if user have permission for "attendances" then he can make attendance of all for his access project list

done
No change mobile side - we will only do server side validations ::

Added in beforeSave of /octobererp/plugins/olabs/social/models/EntityRelations.php

if (!isset($entry['employee_id']))
                return;

            $self_attendance = false;

            if($app->hasPermisson('olabs.oims.my_attendances')){
                if($entry['employee_id'] != "".$app->getAppUserId()){
                    throw new Exception("Error Processing Request", 403);
                    
                }else{
                    $self_attendance  = true;
                }
            }


            if(!$self_attendance  && !$app->hasPermisson('olabs.oims.attendances')){
               
                    throw new Exception("Error Processing Request", 403);
                    
               
            }
5) If user have permission for "vouchers" then he can make a voucher entry for his projects.
done :
   1. we return menu item in mobile only if we have olabs.oims.vouchers permission
   2. also added permission check server side in beforeSave of /octobererp/plugins/olabs/social/models/EntityRelations.php
        if ($this->target_type == self::TARGET_TYPE_VOUCHERS && !$this->status) {
            $this->status = self::STATUS_LIVE;

            $entry = $this->data;
            if (!$entry)
                return;
            $entry = $entry[0];

            
           
            
            if(  !$app->hasPermisson('olabs.oims.vouchers')){
               
                    throw new Exception("Error Processing Request", 403);
                    
               
            }

        }
