## Growl

Use the Growl plugin to turn any Bootstrap alert into an OS X style notification. Growls are fixed to the top right of your viewport and can be dismissed, just like normal Bootstrap alerts.

{% example html %}
<div class="growl growl-static">
  <div class="alert alert-dark alert-dismissable" role="alert">
    <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
      <span aria-hidden="true">Ã—</span>
    </button>
    <strong>Well done!</strong> You successfully read this important alert message.
  </div>
</div>
