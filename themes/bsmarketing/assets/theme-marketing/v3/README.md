#### Docs and Examples

The `docs` directory contains all the static resources for your Themes docs and examples. To view, just open in your favorite browser!

```
$ open docs/index.html
```


#### Gulpfile.js

We've also included an optional Gulp file to help you get started with theme customization. You’ll need to install Node.js and Gulp before using our included gulpfile.js.

To install Node visit [https://nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/download/).

To install gulp, run the following command:

```
$ npm install gulp -g
```

When you’re done, install the rest of the theme's dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

From here on out, simply run `gulp` from your terminal and you're good to go!

+ `gulp` - recompiles and minifies your theme assets.


#### Support

If you experience any problems with the above, or if you think you've found a bug with your theme - please don't hesitate to reach out to themes@getbootstrap.com. thanks!
