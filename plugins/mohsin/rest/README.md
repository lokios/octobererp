# [RESTful-Plugin](https://github.com/SaifurRahmanMohsin/oc-rest-plugin) #
RESTful API management plugin for [OctoberCMS](https://octobercms.com).

## Introduction ##

This plugin allows you to create RESTful controllers.

In a nutshell, it adds the following scaffold command.
```
php artisan create:restcontroller Acme.Plugin ControllerName
```

However, it does more than just that.

## Adding RESTful behavior to existing controller (Without scaffolding) ##

If you prefer not to use the http folder and want the APIs to be mixed in the same controller generated by the create:controller command you may do so. In order to use the REST behavior you should add it to the $implement property of the controller class. Also, the $restConfig class property should be defined and its value should refer to the YAML file used for configuring the behavior options.
```
namespace Acme\Blog\Controllers;

class Categories extends \Backend\Classes\Controller
{
    public $implement = ['Mohsin.Rest.Behaviors.RestController'];
}
```

### API configuration ###

You can create as many RESTful controllers as you like. However, these won't work unless you register them with OctoberCMS. You can do this by defining a registerNodes method in your Plugin.php like this:
```
/**
 * Registers API nodes exposed by this plugin.
 *
 * @return array
 */
public function registerNodes()
{
    return [
        'account/signin' => [
            'controller' => 'Mohsin\User\Http\Account@signin',
            'action'     => 'store'
        ],
        'books' => [
            'controller' => 'Acme\Books',
            'only'       => ['index', 'create', 'show']
        ]
    ];
}
```
